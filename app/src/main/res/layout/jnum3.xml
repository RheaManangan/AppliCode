            JVM is the abbreviation for Java virtual machine which is basically specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java byte code can be executed i.e it is something which is abstract and its implementation is independent to choose the algorithm and has been provided by Sun and other companies. It is JVM which is responsible for converting Byte code to the machine specific code. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.The JVM performs the mentioned tasks: Loads code, Verifies code, Executes code, Provides runtime environment.
            JRE is Java runtime environment which is the implementation of JVM i.e the specifications which are defined in JVM are implemented and creates corresponding environment for the execution of code.JRE comprises mainly java binaries and other classes to execute the program alike of JVM it physically exists. Along with Java binaries JRE also consist of various technologies of deployment, user interfaces to interact with code executed, some base libraries for different functionalities and language and util based libraries.

            JDK is abbreviation for Java Development Kit which includes all the tools, executable and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program.JDK is platform dependent i.e there is separate installers for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.JDK includes both JVM and JRE and is entirely responsible for code execution. It is the version of JDK which represent version of Java"
